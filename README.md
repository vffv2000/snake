Write a description for a snake game project using these libraries: import sys, import random, from PIL import Image, ImageTk, and from tkinter import Tk, Frame, Canvas, ALL, NW.
This project is a snake game developed in Python using the Tkinter library and modules such as sys, random, and PIL. The goal of the game is to control the snake and collect food while avoiding collision with walls or the snake itself.
The main game window is created using the Tkinter library, while the PIL module is used for displaying images such as the snake's head and body as well as the food for collection.
Control keys are set using the sys module, and random is used for creating a random position for food to appear on the screen.
The game also implements score and difficulty level tracking that can be customized according to the player's preference.
Overall, the project serves as a good example of using the Tkinter graphical interface to create a simple yet engaging game in Python.
